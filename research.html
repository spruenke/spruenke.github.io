     	 		<p>The drastic growth of the cryptocurrencies market capitalization boosts investigation of their diversification benefits in portfolio construction. In this paper with a set of classical and modern measurement tools, we assess the out-of-sample performance of eight portfolio allocation strategies relative to the naive 1/N rule applied to traditional and crypto-assets investment universe. <br><br>

     	 		Evaluated strategies include a range from classical Markowitz rule to the recently introduced LIBRO approach (Trimborn et al. in Journal of Financial Econometrics 1–27, 2019). Furthermore, we also compare three extensions for strategies with respect to input estimators applied. <br><br>

     	 		The results show that in the presence of alternative assets, such as cryptocurrencies, mean–variance strategies underperform the benchmark portfolio. In contrast, CVaR optimization tends to outperform the benchmark as well as geometric optimization, although we find a strong dependence of the former’s success on trading costs. <br><br>

     	 		Furthermore, we find evidence that liquidity-bounded strategies tend to perform very well. Thus, our findings underscore the non-normal distribution of returns and the necessity to control for liquidity constraints at alternative asset markets.</p>

		<h4>Background</h4>
		The Berlin Grading System assesses clinical severity of moyamoya angiopathy (MMA) by combining MRI, DSA, and cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CVRC). Our aim was to validate this grading system using [15O]H2O PET for CVRC. We retrospectively identified bilateral MMA patients who underwent [15O]H2O PET examination and were treated surgically at our department. Each hemisphere was classified using the Suzuki and Berlin Grading System. Preoperative symptoms and perioperative ischemias were collected, and a logistic regression analysis was performed. A total of 100 hemispheres in 50 MMA patients (36 women, 14 men) were included. Using the Berlin Grading System, 2 (2.8%) of 71 symptomatic hemispheres were categorized as grade I, 14 (19.7%) as grade II, and 55 (77.5%) as grade III. The 29 asymptomatic hemispheres were characterized as grade I in 7 (24.1%) hemispheres, grade II in 12 (41.4%), and grade III in 10 (34.5%) hemispheres. Berlin grades were independent factors for identifying hemispheres as symptomatic and higher grades correlated with increasing proportion of symptomatic hemispheres (p < 0.01). The Suzuki grading did not correlate with preoperative symptoms (p = 0.26). Perioperative ischemic complications occurred in 8 of 88 operated hemispheres. Overall, complications did not occur in any of the grade I hemispheres, but in 9.1% (n = 2 of 22) and 9.8% (n = 6 of 61) of grade II and III hemispheres, respectively. In this study, we validated the Berlin Grading System with the use of [15O]H2O PET for CVRC as it could stratify preoperative symptomatology. Furthermore, we highlighted its relevance for predicting perioperative ischemic complications.

   	      <h5> European Journal of Cancer, 2022</h5>
   	      <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Abstract</button>
   	      <div class="content_s">
   	      <h4>Background</h4>
Targeted therapies for metastatic uveal melanoma have shown limited benefit in biomarker-unselected populations. The Treat20 Plus study prospectively evaluated the feasibility of a precision oncology strategy in routine clinical practice.

<h4>Patients and methods</h4>
Fresh biopsies were analyzed by high-throughput genomics (whole-genome, whole-exome, and RNA sequencing). A multidisciplinary molecular and immunologic tumor board (MiTB) made individualized treatment recommendations based on identified molecular aberrations, patient situation, drug, and clinical trial availability. Therapy selection was at the discretion of the treating physician. The primary endpoint was the feasibility of the precision oncology clinical program.

<h4>Results</h4>
Molecular analyses were available for 39/45 patients (87%). The MiTB provided treatment recommendations for 40/45 patients (89%), of whom 27/45 (60%) received ≥1 matched therapy. First-line matched therapies included MEK inhibitors (n = 15), MET inhibitors (n = 10), sorafenib (n = 1), and nivolumab (n = 1). The best response to first-line matched therapy was partial response in one patient (nivolumab based on tumor mutational burden), mixed response in two patients, and stable disease in 12 patients for a clinical benefit of 56%. The matched therapy population had a median progression-free survival and overall survival of 3.3 and 13.9 months, respectively. The growth modulation index with matched therapy was >1.33 in 6/17 patients (35%) with prior systemic therapy, suggesting clinical benefit.

<h4>Conclusions</h4>
A precision oncology approach was feasible for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma, with 60% receiving a therapy matched to identify molecular aberrations. The clinical benefit after checkpoint inhibitors highlights the value of tumor mutational burden testing.

			<button type="button" class="collapsible"> Abstract</button>
			<div class="content_s">
				Objective: In advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), adjuvant therapy (AT) is an important part of the treatment to ensure extended locoregional control after primary surgical resection. The impact of the time interval between surgery and AT on the oncological prognosis remains unclear, particularly in high-risk constellations. The aim of this study is to categorize treatment delays and to determine their impact on the oncological prognosis within the context of the histopathological risk parameters of patients with advanced OSCC.In this single-institutional retrospective cohort study, all patients treated for OSCC between 2016 and 2021 and who received postoperative chemoradiation (POCRT) were included.Patients were divided into two groups: Group I: ≤ 6 weeks between surgery and POCRT; and Group II: > 6 weeks between surgery and POCRT.Results: Overall, 202 patients were included (Group I: 156 (77.2%) vs. Group II: 46 (22.8%)). There were no statistically significant differences in epidemiological aspects and histopathological risk factors between the two groups. The maximum time to initiation of POCRT was 11 weeks. Delayed POCRT initiation had no statistically significant influence on the 5-year OS (61.6% vs. 57.3%, p = 0.89), locoregional control rate (38.6% vs. 43.3%, p = 0.57), and RFS (32.3% vs. 30.4%, p = 0.21).
