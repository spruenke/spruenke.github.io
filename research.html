     	 		The drastic growth of the cryptocurrencies market capitalization boosts investigation of their diversification benefits in portfolio construction. In this paper with a set of classical and modern measurement tools, we assess the out-of-sample performance of eight portfolio allocation strategies relative to the naive 1/N rule applied to traditional and crypto-assets investment universe. Evaluated strategies include a range from classical Markowitz rule to the recently introduced LIBRO approach (Trimborn et al. in Journal of Financial Econometrics 1–27, 2019). Furthermore, we also compare three extensions for strategies with respect to input estimators applied. The results show that in the presence of alternative assets, such as cryptocurrencies, mean–variance strategies underperform the benchmark portfolio. In contrast, CVaR optimization tends to outperform the benchmark as well as geometric optimization, although we find a strong dependence of the former’s success on trading costs. Furthermore, we find evidence that liquidity-bounded strategies tend to perform very well. Thus, our findings underscore the non-normal distribution of returns and the necessity to control for liquidity constraints at alternative asset markets.

   	      <h4>Background</h4>
Targeted therapies for metastatic uveal melanoma have shown limited benefit in biomarker-unselected populations. The Treat20 Plus study prospectively evaluated the feasibility of a precision oncology strategy in routine clinical practice.

<h4>Patients and methods</h4>
Fresh biopsies were analyzed by high-throughput genomics (whole-genome, whole-exome, and RNA sequencing). A multidisciplinary molecular and immunologic tumor board (MiTB) made individualized treatment recommendations based on identified molecular aberrations, patient situation, drug, and clinical trial availability. Therapy selection was at the discretion of the treating physician. The primary endpoint was the feasibility of the precision oncology clinical program.

<h4>Results</h4>
Molecular analyses were available for 39/45 patients (87%). The MiTB provided treatment recommendations for 40/45 patients (89%), of whom 27/45 (60%) received ≥1 matched therapy. First-line matched therapies included MEK inhibitors (n = 15), MET inhibitors (n = 10), sorafenib (n = 1), and nivolumab (n = 1). The best response to first-line matched therapy was partial response in one patient (nivolumab based on tumor mutational burden), mixed response in two patients, and stable disease in 12 patients for a clinical benefit of 56%. The matched therapy population had a median progression-free survival and overall survival of 3.3 and 13.9 months, respectively. The growth modulation index with matched therapy was >1.33 in 6/17 patients (35%) with prior systemic therapy, suggesting clinical benefit.

<h4>Conclusions</h4>
A precision oncology approach was feasible for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma, with 60% receiving a therapy matched to identify molecular aberrations. The clinical benefit after checkpoint inhibitors highlights the value of tumor mutational burden testing.
